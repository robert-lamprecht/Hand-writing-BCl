## Setup
1. Clone this repository
3. Create virtual environment: 'python -m venv bci-env'
4. Activate environment: 'source bci-env/bin/activate'
5. Install dependencies: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
Note: 
    Requirements are likely to update as we develop.  
    As a default, I just included libraries I thought would be helpful to get us started.

## Project Structure

'data/': contains the BCI dataset
